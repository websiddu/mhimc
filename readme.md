# Housing Hackathon: Should I Really Live Here?

The purpose of our app is to help people evaluate the safety of the place they want to move to. Our method is to visualize the safety condition by counting the number of incidents in half mile around your address and to compare it to the Seattle’s average. In this way, we want to give them a better understanding of the community, and thus support them to make smart decision.

This application was developed on February 8th, 2015 for the [Hack Housing: Empowering Smarter Decisions – A Weekend Hackathon](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/hack-housing-empowering-smarter-decisions-a-weekend-hackathon-registration-15310832111).

Our app is live at http://canilivehere.herokuapp.com/. You can input your address in Seattle on the main page, and click enter to see our suggestion.

## Challenge and Approach

Our submission is for a broader challenge in the candidate problems. This is because all of the users, seniors, low-income families and first-time homebuyers, they need to take safety into consideration when choosing a new house.

Our approach for satisfying this challenge was to:
- Easy way to know if a place is safe to live in
- Comparison between Seattle crimes and your location
Once we did that, we knew we were guaranteed to win!
